# Hello, I'm Adeola Mufliah Adelodun

I am a Cyber Security Master's student at the University of Roehampton. I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact. I am dedicated to building expertise in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).

My academic and practical journey in cybersecurity has equipped me with skills and hands-on experience in risk management, network security, and ethical hacking. I aim to contribute to cybersecurity by implementing secure solutions and protecting digital assets.
I am passionate about learning, sharing knowledge and giving back to the community.
